## In this Repository

This project aims to develop a Vehicle Routing Bot (VRB) for efficient pickups and deliveries in a warehouse environment. The VRB utilizes a Raspberry Pi for ROS and communication with an Arduino-Uno microcontroller to control motors and sensors for Line detection and obstacle avoidance. The goal of this project is to reduce transportation costs and the number of required modes of transportation. The VRB prototype can be implemented in various fields like postal service providers, delivery service companies and more. This project aims to improve the efficiency and productivity of logistics operations.
